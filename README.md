# Intracranial-Hemorrhage-Detection
Bleeding that occurs inside the cranium is a serious medical problem which requires rapid medical attention.

Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For example, intracranial hemorrhages account for approximately 10% of strokes in the U.S., where stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death. Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient.

Diagnosis requires an urgent procedure. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such as severe headache or loss of consciousness, highly trained specialists review medical images of the patient’s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. The process is complicated and often time consuming.

now we are building  an algorithm to detect acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes.

we’ll develop your solution using a rich image dataset provided by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in collaboration with members of the American Society of Neuroradiology.

If successful, you’ll help the medical community identify the presence, location and type of hemorrhage in order to quickly and effectively treat affected patients.
